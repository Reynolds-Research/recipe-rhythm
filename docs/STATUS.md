# Recipe-Rhythm — Project Status

> **Single source of truth for "where are we?"** This file is updated as part of every PR that completes a PRD phase or a P-numbered requirement. If you find it stale, that itself is a bug — flag it in the next session and update it before doing anything else.
>
> Planning happens in Claude Cowork (Claude Desktop). Execution happens in Claude Code. This file is the bridge between the two surfaces.

**Last verified:** 2026-05-04 against `origin/main` @ `24eb870` (PR #80 merged)
**Maintained by:** whoever ships a PRD phase (Claude Code) — see "How this file is maintained" at the bottom.

## At a glance

| PRD | Title | Overall status | Next thing to plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRD-001 | Recipe Vault & Cooking Record | ✅ **All P0 + P1.1 shipped** (v1.0) | P1.2–P1.6 nice-to-haves; not blocking anything |
| PRD-002 | Meal Planning | ✅ **All P0 shipped** | P1 nice-to-haves |
| PRD-003 | Grocery Tracking | 🟡 **Phase 1 partially shipped** (Bite C-1) | Pantry staples (P0.2), ad-hoc add (P0.7), share-link infra (P0.9–P0.11) |
| PRD-004 | Smarter Ingredient Filtering | 🟡 **Phase A + Phase B shipped** | Phase C (filter behavior change) — the user-visible flip |
| PRD-005 | Mobile UX, Spacing & Typography | ✅ **All P0 shipped** (Phases 1–8 + lint guardrail) | P1 nice-to-haves (BrainstormMode decomposition is the big one) |
| PRD-006 | Structured Ingredients + Household Composition | 🟡 **Bites α + β + Path D1 + truth-hierarchy shipped** | Bite γ (re-parse on edit); **also: author the PRD doc** |

⚠️ **Documentation gap:** PRD-006 has 6+ shipped PRs but no markdown file in `docs/prds/`. The schema is documented in `docs/schema.md`, but there's no PRD specifying scope, phasing, or success metrics. Authoring this is itself a "next thing."

## PRD-006 — Structured Ingredients + Household Composition

> ⚠️ **Documentation gap:** No PRD markdown file in `docs/prds/`. Schema is captured in `docs/schema.md`. Authoring `docs/prds/PRD-006-*.md` is itself a pending item — without it, scope and success metrics aren't pinned down anywhere. (Inferred name from commit messages and schema.md.)

### Shipped (inferred from commits)

- [x] **Bite α** (PR #75, commit `103eb1c`, P0.1): structured-ingredients schema (`vault.ingredients_structured jsonb`, `vault.servings int`) + household composition (`household_preferences.adults`, `household_preferences.children` + CHECK constraint).
- [x] **Bite β** (PR #77, commit `1e2c518`): backfill script for existing vault rows + household-size preferences UI.
- [x] **Cooking-method scope fix** (PR #76, commit `cd25f99`): scope `cooking_method` to dish-level technique, not sub-steps.
- [x] **Backfill script fix** (commit `dfc3a12`): select category arrays, not `vault.ingredients`.
- [x] **Backfill registered as npm script** (PR #79, commit `610bf9d`): `backfill:structured-ingredients`.
- [x] **Path D1** (PR #78, commit `096778d`): chip-grounded ingredient re-extraction.
- [x] **Truth-hierarchy chip-grounding prompt** (PR #80, commit `b5af1eb`): explicit truth-hierarchy in chip-grounding prompt.

### Pending (inferred)

- [ ] **Bite γ** — re-parse on edit (referenced in `docs/schema.md` as "Bite γ"); P0.7 work per schema.md callouts.
- [ ] **PRD-006 markdown doc itself** — author it with scope, phases, success metrics, open questions.

## How this file is maintained

1. **When you finish a PRD phase or a P-numbered requirement**, update this file in the same PR that ships the work:
   - Move the relevant line from "Pending" to "Shipped" in the right PRD section.
   - Note the PR number and the commit hash if helpful.
   - Update the "Last verified" line at the top with today's date and the latest commit hash.
2. **At the start of every Cowork planning session**, the planner reads this file first and runs `git log --oneline -20` to confirm it matches reality. If they don't match, the session starts by reconciling — not by planning new work.
3. **At the start of every Claude Code execution session**, the executor reads this file alongside `CLAUDE.md` to understand current state before touching anything.
4. **Outdated `STATUS.md` is a release blocker.** Treat it the same as outdated `docs/schema.md` — if a reviewer notices drift, the PR doesn't merge until both are reconciled.

If this file ever falls out of sync (because a PR forgot to update it), recover by:

```bash
git log --oneline --since="2 weeks ago" | head -50
# Cross-check each PRD-tagged commit against the relevant PRD section.
```

…then update this file and call out in the next PR description that you reconciled drift.
