# Recipe Rhythm — Session log

Newest on top. One entry per working session, written at the end of it, so the next session can
start clean: **Done** (with PR numbers) · **Verified** (what was checked, how) · **Open / owed** ·
**Next** (the one `TASKS.md` item to pick up). Keep entries short; detail lives in PRs and STATUS.

## 2026-10-30 — project-system audit fixes (Cowork, Linux PC)

**Done:** this PR. Added `docs/NORTH-STAR.md` (DRAFT for Matt), the `reviewer` subagent, a "Definition of done" in `CLAUDE.md`, `CI` on every PR (Vitest + build), this log. `TASKS.md` is now the single next-work list with a Done-when per item (ROADMAP folded in). The PRD-drift audit prompt points at STATUS / NORTH-STAR / PRD-001–007 / ADR-001–005 instead of the retired `RECIPE_TODOS.md`. The audit runner runs on Linux (`scripts/systemd/`, not armed). STATUS reconciled to `18b60cb`. The two 2026-10-25 commits from `backup/pre-migration-2026-10-25` were carried onto `main` here.

**Verified:** `npm run build` passes on `main`. `npx vitest run` on `main`: 27 of 62 files fail at import (React 19.2.7 vs react-dom 19.2.6); the 529 tests that load pass. So `CI` will be red until FIX-REACT-PAIR lands — that's the gate working.

**Open / owed (Matt):** ratify or edit `docs/NORTH-STAR.md`; decide where audit findings go before arming the timer (the repo is public); switch the PC checkout from the backup branch to `main` after merge.

**Next:** FIX-REACT-PAIR, then P0-1.
