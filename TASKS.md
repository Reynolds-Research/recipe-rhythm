## Security

- [ ] **Fix high-severity Vite vulnerability** (reported 2026-04-18 by `npm audit`)
  - Package: `vite` 8.0.0 – 8.0.4 (currently installed)
  - Advisories:
    - [GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9) — Path traversal in optimized deps `.map` handling
    - [GHSA-v2wj-q39q-566r](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v2wj-q39q-566r) — `server.fs.deny` bypassed with queries
    - [GHSA-p9ff-h696-f583](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p9ff-h696-f583) — Arbitrary file read via dev-server WebSocket
  - Fix: `npm audit fix` (upgrades Vite past 8.0.4). Re-run `npm run test:unit -- --run` and `npm run build` afterward to confirm nothing regressed.
  - Impact: dev-server only — no production exposure, but still worth patching.
